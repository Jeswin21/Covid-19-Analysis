# Covid-19-Analysis

Internship Project 2

Developed a Data analysis to gather data for 3 countries affected by Covid-19 using Pandas and NumPy.

Performed Data Analysis by Pre-processing and Forecasting the data to differentiate the countries based on active cases, deaths, recovery rates, and vaccinations 
using Matplotlib which simplified the dataset.

3 Datasets were taken from Kaggle to design 100% real-time interactive dashboards in Tableau for data visualization to create line graphs, calendar graphs, maps, 
and bar graphs based on vaccination, total cases, deaths, and recoveries for better visual clarification where these projects ensured that customer understood the 
date and time of the events that occurred.
