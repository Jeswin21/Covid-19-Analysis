Performed Data Analysis by Pre-processing and Forecasting the data to differentiate the countries based on active cases, deaths, recovery rates, and vaccinations 
using Matplotlib which simplified the dataset.

3 Datasets were taken from Kaggle to design 100% real-time interactive dashboards in Tableau for data visualization to create line graphs, calendar graphs, maps, and 
bar graphs based on vaccination, total cases, deaths, recoveries for better visual clarification where these projects ensured that customer understood the date and 
time of the events that occurred.
